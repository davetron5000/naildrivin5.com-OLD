    <p>On Jan 3, I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/davetron5000/status/21943399506509824">tweeted</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All personal stuff only on iPad; no twitter, email, or RSS on work computer. Will it keep me more focused?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially, what I decided to try doing was to bring my iPad to work every day, and use it for Twitter, RSS, and personal emails.  The only &quot;personal&quot; stuff I would be doing on my work machine would be IM, simply because the IM experience on iPad is not very good, and the immediacy of it would be lost on a computer that&#39;s not right in front of me.  I don&#39;t do a lot of personal IM&#39;ing anyway, so this seemed like a good compromise.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Normally, I get all kinds of notifications on my machine: new emails, new stories in RSS, new tweets, etc.  This divides my focus.  I&#39;ll spend upwards of five minutes reading mail or blogs while waiting for a <em>two</em> minute test run to complete.  Not good.  It&#39;s hard enough to focus where I work as it is, so I thought this would help.  Further, when I <em>do</em> take a break and focus on RSS or personal email, I&#39;m bombarded with work-related things&hellip;the very things I&#39;m trying to take a break from!</p>

<h2>How did it go?</h2>

<p>In a word: &quot;smashing.&quot;</p>

<p>I tended to keep Twitter for iPad running, as that&#39;s pretty easy to duck in and out of.  <em>Any</em> interesting link, I sent right to <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> for reading on the train home.  I only read RSS feeds a couple times a day, usually during lunch, and during the dreaded 3pm doldrums where I just start fading and need a break.</p>

<p>I got to most personal emails I would normally deal with, however, because of the iPad&#39;s virtual keyboard, I pushed off dealing with emails that required a bit more writing.  This turns out to be a good thing, because most of the time these sorts of emails can just wait until I get home.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to keep it going as long as I can; I think it&#39;s going to be a great way to maintain focus without just ditching the handy notification systems that are useful throughout the day.  When I&#39;m working, I&#39;m not thinking about personal email or what&#39;s been posted to Daring Fireball.  When I&#39;m taking a break, I&#39;m just dealing with email, taking in blog entries and <em>actually</em> recharging for the next block of work.</p>

<p>I <em>don&#39;t</em> think this would be possible on just a phone; the iPad provides a near-to-a-real-computer enough experience that I can do just about everything I need to on it.</p>
