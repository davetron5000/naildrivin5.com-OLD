<h1>ScalaFunctions</h1>
<h2>The Gist</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/133">Anonymous Functions</a> gives an overview of Scala’s support for functions as actual parts of the programming language. <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/134">Higher-Order Functions</a> explains how functions can take functions as arguments and also return functions.</p>
<h2>My Interpretation</h2>
<p>Scala is more than just an object-oriented language with a compact syntax; it has extensive support for functional programming. As such, functions are first-class objects.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a list of U.S. States and wish to search by postal abbreviation. In Java, you’d do something like this:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/152429.js">
</script>
<p>While this is reasonably clear, in Java you tend to write a lot of code like this, where you iterate over a list and “do something”. The main problem is that when you find out later you need to search by some other attribute, you write essentially the same looping and early-return structure.</p>
<p>Scala inverts this by allow you to pass in just the comparison function:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/152432.js">
</script>
<p>The expression given to the <code>find</code> method is a function literal, or <strong>anonymous function</strong>. The argument to the <code>find</code> method is declared to have the type <code>(T) =&gt; Boolean</code>, which is to say “A function that takes one argument of type ‘T’, where ‘T’ is the type of elements in the list, and returns a boolean.”</p>
<p>In our case, since the list is a list of <code>State</code> objects, the type of the function is <code>(State) =&gt; Boolean</code>, or “A function that takes one argument of type <code>State</code> and returns a <code>Boolean</code>.” Note that this entire expression is the type, the same as <code>int</code> or <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> would be in Java. Also note that the expression <code>(state)</code> is a way in which we name the argument that would be passed to the function (Scala understands the type of this argument based on the context in which it is called).</p>
<p>That type is actually shorthand for <code>Function1[State,Boolean]</code>, where the method <code>apply</code> is what is called when the function is called. The Scala compiler translates the shorthand for you.</p>
<p>Further, you can pass functions around just like variables and other values.</p>

<p>A few more interesting things about functions in Scala:</p>
<ul>
<li>Methods of an object can be passed as functions</li>
<li>Methods and functions <strong>are not</strong> the same thing</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions, their definitions, and their behavior are a very deep subject, but this should give you a flavor of what they can do. If you’ve done a lot of list manipulation (or Swing programming), you should be able to see that functions can save you from writing a ton of code…and result in much clearer code.</p>
<h2>My Thoughts on this Feature</h2>
<p>I dig this quite a bit. I could use this at work <strong>right now</strong> if it were available in Java. While many examples of Scala use functions in a way that <strong>really</strong> confuses things, I still think this feature has the power to simplify and clarify a lot of code. It is the logical continuation of the “inversion of control” concept; here, a class can ask for code it needs, instead of exporting its data.</p>
