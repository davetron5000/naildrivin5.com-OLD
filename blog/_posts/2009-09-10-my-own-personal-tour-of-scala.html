<p>So, the <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Main Scala Website</a> has a "tour" of the features of Scala.  I liked the idea, but found a lot of the examples and descriptions a bit terse and uninspiring (some of them are downright confusing).  However, I really wanted to learn about these features.  So, I set about understanding each feature, trying to answer the question "What problem does this solve?".  The results are here at <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour">www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour</a>.  This site was constructed using my homebrew wiki software, <a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/halen/tree/master">Halen</a> (which I created to test out my <a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/gliffy/tree/master">Gliffy Ruby client</a>).
</p>

It was a fun experience.  As someone coming from Java application development (and who knows enough Ruby to feel some pain in Java), I tried hard to map the features to real-world problems a "blue-collar developer" might be facing.  A lot of Scala enthusiasts seem to be functional programming nerds, and I know FP can turn a lot of people off.  I think Scala is a great way to learn and appreciate functional programming without having to swallow a huge amount of info at once.  So, I figured approaching Scala's features from a different angle would be useful.
</p>
<p>
I <b>did</b> have to supplement my learning with info from Odersky's awesome <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Comprehensive-Step-step/dp/0981531601/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1252628682&sr=8-1">Programming Scala</a> book, but most of what I learned, I learned by playing around with code; all the code on the site should compile and run (at least in Scala 2.7.x).  The coolest thing was that by "touring" all of Scala's (often weird) features, I got a good feel for how they all fit together.  The language feels like a very elaborate Rube-Goldberg Machine that ends up being rather elegant.  I feel that instead of casting Scala as a functional language, or a hybrid language, I would say that Scala is "static typing done right (or as right as is possible)".  
</p>
<p>The way Scala allows for <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/DuckTyping">duck typing</a>, for example, is really cool, and something I think Ruby code could benefit from.
Stuff like <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/TypeVariance">type variance</a> is pretty heavy stuff, but when you dig into, and understand how functions are implemented, it ends up making some sense.  I even found a "real world" use for <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ExplcitlyTypedSelfReferences">explictly-typed self-references</a>, which I thought was actually a sick joke for a while  :) Anyway, I hope that what I've learned doing this will be helpful to others.
