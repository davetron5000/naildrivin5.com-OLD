            <p>My new Book, <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/dcbang/rails-angular-postgres-and-bootstrap">Rails, Angular, Postgres, and Bootstrap: Powerful, Effective, and Efficient Full-Stack Web Development</a> is in beta:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a Rails developer, you care about user experience and performance, but you also want simple and maintainable code. Achieve all that by embracing the full stack of web development, from styling with Twitter Bootstrap, building an interactive user interface with AngularJS, to storing data quickly and reliably in PostgreSQL. Take a holistic view of full-stack development to create usable, high-performing applications, and learn to use these technologies effectively in a Ruby on Rails environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been working on this for quite a while, and pretty excited about it.  If you want to <em>really</em> level
up your abilities as a Rails developer, this is the book for you.</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t been good at blogging for a while.  Most of my writing has been toward a new book (details
forthcoming), but I did manage to write up how I see designing service objects for Rails applications
over at <a href="http://technology.stitchfix.com/blog">Stitch Fix&#39;s Eng Blog</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://technology.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/06/02/anatomy-of-service-objects-in-rails/">Anatomy of a Rails Service Object</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ve given up on “fat models, skinny controllers” as a design style for our Rails apps—in fact we abandoned it before we started. Instead, we factor our code into special-purpose classes, commonly called service objects. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The post goes over six rules of thumb that I&#39;ve found useful, including class design, method parameter,
and return values.</p>

<li><strong>Understand what problem you are trying to solve.</strong>  <em>So</em> many skip this, or don&#39;t spend enough time on it or don&#39;t even <em>realize</em> that it&#39;s something to do.  The main failure of good <em>programmers</em> that I&#39;ve seen is in not knowing what problem they were trying to solve.</li>
<li><strong>Figure out what you need to do to solve the problem before you solve it.</strong>  This can be anything from skimming the code you&#39;re about to change to organizing your thoughts in a full-blown <a href="http://technology.stitchfix.com/blog/2014/12/02/some-design-up-front/">design document</a>.  You have to have a good idea of how you&#39;re going to go about solving the problem in the code.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can apply these steps to pretty much anything you need to do, from fixing bugs, to implementing features, to writing
emails, to holding meetings.  If you know what problem you&#39;re trying to solve, and have a good sense of how you&#39;re going to do
it, actually solving it becomes a lot simpler and a lot easier to get right.</p>

            <p><a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/">Giles Bowkett</a> posted <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2014/09/why-scrum-should-basically-just-die-in.html">a great piece on the deep flaws of Agile processes like Scrum</a>.
It&#39;s spot-on with my experience.
There&#39;s so many choice quotes, it&#39;s hard to pull just one, but I&#39;ll try.
Toward the end of the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve never seen Scrum-like frameworks for transmuting the work of designers, marketers, or accountants into cartoonish oversimplifications like story points. People are happy to treat these workers as adults and trust them to do their jobs.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why this same trust does not prevail in the culture of managing programmers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a job converting JIRA Tickets into Story Points into diffs, I eventually realized that good developers <a href="http://naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/01/27/what-i-learned-working-at-livingsocial.html">deliver results</a>, not promises, points, or even features.
I even <a href="http://theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">wrote an entire book about it</a>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the <a href="http://tech.stitchfix.com">team at Stitch Fix</a> has no sprints, story points,
velocity, or planning poker.  We just solve the most important problem at hand, and
move onto the next most important one.</p>

it any time soon, as DHH has doubled-down on &quot;server-generated JavaScript responses&quot;.</p>

            <p><a href="http://twitter.com/garybernhardt">@garybernhardt</a> linked to a short academic paper on code readability, called <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.5257.pdf">&quot;What Makes Code Hard to Understand?&quot;</a>.  It&#39;s a quick read that details an experiment where researchers showed severals versions of the same program to a bunch of programmers and asked them to guess the output.  Each version had the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a> and lines of code, but differed only in formatting, variable naming, and use of types.</p>

<p>Choice quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The physical aspects of notation, often considered superficial, can have a profound impact on performance [of programmers to understand what code will
do]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In particular, in a program that relied on order of operations, two versions were given, one in which one space was used around operators (<code>zigzag</code>) and
another where the operators were all vertically aligned (<code>linedup</code>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Programmers were more likely to respect the order of mathematical operations in the <code>linedup</code> version of <code>whitespace</code>, showing how horizontal space can emphasize the common structure between related calculations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, they presented three versions of code to calculate the area of a rectangle, using free variables, tuples, and a <code>Rectangle</code> class:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Programmers took longer to respond to the <code>tuples</code> version of <code>rectangle</code> despite it having fewer lines than the <code>class</code> version. It is not uncommon in Python to use tuples for (x, y) coordinates, but the syntactic &quot;noise&quot; that is present in the tuples version for variable names (e.g., <code>r1_xy_1</code>) and calculations (e.g., <code>width = xy_2[0] - xy_1[0]</code>) likely gave programmers pause when verifying the code&#39;s operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was not something that was initially obvious to me as I learned programming, but I have come to realize the importance of typography in writing
  code.  From <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/05/17/source-code-typography.html">my post</a> on the subject over a year ago:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, it&#39;s not just the content - the code itself - that affects readability. How it&#39;s presented matters and if we&#39;re going to talk about presentation, we have to talk about typography.</p>

I <em>can</em> say what your average developer (including myself) actually creates using object-oriented languages, tools, and techniques.
The result is a constant battle to tame complexity.
I&#39;m going to lay out one source of that complexity, because it&#39;s baked-in to object-orientation, and I debate that it provides any utility in making programs easy to understand or change.</p>
