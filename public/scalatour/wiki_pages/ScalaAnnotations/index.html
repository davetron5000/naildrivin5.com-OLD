<h1>ScalaAnnotations</h1>
<h2>The Gist</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/106">Annotations</a> gives a pretty decent overview of how annotations are used in Scala.</p>
<h2>My Interpretations</h2>
<p>Annotations in Scala are conceptually the same as they are in Java. Many of the Java keyword modifiers are annotations in Scala (as opposed to language constructs). For example, <code>native</code> in Java is the annotation <code>scala.native</code>.</p>
<p>For the purposes of interacting with Java, Scala classes may annotate methods with the <code>throws</code> annotation. This is the equivalent of the the <code>throws</code> keyword in Java and lets the Java compiler know what exceptions must be caught.</p>
<p>Java Annotations, when used in Scala, are specified using one of two types of syntax:</p>

</script>
<p>One way in which Scala uses annotations is to bridge Scala’s way of dealing with properties and Java’s way:</p>

</script>
<p>The <code>BeanProperty</code> annotation basically creates these methods for us. This lets Scala code work with systems like Spring (that expect the get/set style) without having duplicated code in our Scala source.</p>
<h2>My Thoughts on this Feature</h2>
<p>I’ve never felt like annotations were a particularly good addition to Java; they always seemed like a hack to support poorly designed frameworks like J2EE and JAX-RS. I don’t know how endemic they are to Scala at this time, so lets hope they don’t get used much. Scala is a much more expressive language than Java and I think it can get by without annotations being used all over the place.</p>
<p>Also, the use of parens vs. braces seems needlessly inconsistent.</p>
