<h1>TypeSpecialization</h1>
<h2>The Gist</h2>
<p>This isn’t covered by the tour.</p>
<h2>My Interpretation</h2>
<p>Type Specialization is a feature that allows the Scala compiler to create type-specific versions of classes that take type parameters. For example, if you have a collection of type <code>Collection[T]</code>, and you specialize <code>T</code>, the compiler will create not just one class, but one for each primitive type as well as for the object type.</p>
<p>This is entirely transparent to the programmer, and essentially is useful for optimizing code that is being slowed down by autoboxing.</p>

</script>
<p>Note that the more type parameters you specialize, the more specialized classes are created, because each combination of primitives must be created to full specialize.</p>
<p>For a great overview, watch <a href="http://days2010.scala-lang.org/node/138/151">this talk</a> from ScalaDays 2010</p>
<h2>My Thoughts on This Feature</h2>
<p>On one hand, this seems like a hyper-optimization that you should rarely really need. On the other hand, I can’t see a reason not to always do this, so why is it a feature at all? I suspect this is only useful for API writers who need to squeeze every ounce of performance out of their code.</p>
