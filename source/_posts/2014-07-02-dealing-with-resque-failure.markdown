Over on [Stitch Fix's engineering blog][1], I wrote a [new post][2] on how we deal with tricky job failures.
Namely, make your jobs idempotent:

> Trapping `Resque::TermException` is really just kicking the can down the road. You might prevent some of your jobs from failing, but you'll still get failed jobs. Granted, they will fail at a lower rate, but it's still a rate correlated to the scale of your business.

> The underlying problem is that jobs aren't **idempotent**.

Check out the entire thing [here][2].
