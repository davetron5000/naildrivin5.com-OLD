<h1>ScalaOperators</h1>
<h2>The Gist</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/118">Scala Operators</a> shows a very short example of creating “operator-like” method calls.</p>
<h2>My Interpretation</h2>
<p>A method that takes one parameter can be used as if it were an operator, which is to say, without a dot or parenthesis.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to use Ruby’s <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> operator as a sorting mechanism.</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/155984.js">
</script>
<p>Since Scala has very liberal rules about what can be in an identifier, you can make a method called <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> and it works just fine. The function we pass to <code>sort</code> function could also be written like so:</p>
<pre>(a,b) =&gt; a.&lt;=&gt;(b)</pre>
<p>A few caveats, however. For some reason, if your method ends in a colon, it is applied to the identifer to its right, not its left.</p>
<pre>def :::: (other:Person) = other.age
def foo  (other:Person) = other.age
println(dave :::: rudy) // prints dave’s age
println(dave foo rudy)  // prints rudy’s age</pre>
<p>Also, for some reason, if you wish to create a method that looks like an assignment, you must use an underscore:</p>
<pre>def age_=(newAge:Int)
foo.age = 45</pre>
<h2>My Thoughts on this Feature</h2>
<p>The colon and underscore stuff is seemingly random. I guess there’s some math mumbo jumbo that says</p>
<pre>element :: list # puts element onto the front of list</pre>
<p>and so that’s why that’s there. Subtle. As for the <code>_=</code> stuff, I’m at a loss; Ruby seems to be able to handle this more clearly, so it’s anyone’s guess.</p>
<p>Overall though, I guess this is all handy for creating DSLs. Seems odd, though, that we still need parens around expressions in <code>if</code> statements.</p>
