<h1 class="main-title">Another Tour of Scala</h1>
<article>
<h1>AboutThisWiki</h1>
<p>I find the <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/104">tour of Scala</a> a nice idea, but found many of the examples wanting; sometimes for general clarity, but mostly because I kept asking myself “why should I care about this feature?”</p>
<p>As an application developer, mathematical examples aren’t particularly satisfying or exciting. As a Java developer, I was also interested in how Scala improves on Java, with respect to a particular language feature.</p>
<p>So, I went through every element of the tour and worked out the feature myself, trying to map it to real-world scenarios I (and, presumably many others) have faced. I find a real (if simplified) context makes not only comprehending a language feature simpler, but also leaves me with a feeling of <strong>why</strong> the feature exists and <strong>what good</strong> it does.</p>
<p>I want new languages and tools to make my life easier in some way, and I feel that many of Scala’s features do that. However this was not obvious to me from the tour.</p>
<p>I also thought it would be a bit more helpful to order the tour elements so that things flowed better, as well as some introductory material that clears up some syntax that I found counter-intuitive the first time. I also added a few of my own stops on the tour that I thought would’ve been nice to have the first time through.</p>
<p>Finally, I can’t pass up the opportunity to comment on these features, so each one contains my thoughts at the bottom, which you can skip if you aren’t interested.</p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I get paid to write Java, and have been so paid for about 10 years (before which I did C and C++). I also write a fair amount of Ruby code, so the concept of a concise language geared toward productivity is not foreign to me.</p>
<p>That being said, most of <strong>my</strong> examples show “the way you’d have to do it in Java” and then “the Scala way”. I figure most people will come to Scala from Java and appreciate the comparison.</p>
