So, I am finally employed and I didn't even have to settle.  After a refreshingly protracted and detailed interview process, I'm finally schlepping myself to a job that I'm more or less excited about.  That's saying something, since I've spent the last 8 months at home (6.5 of them working for Gliffy) in my perfect environment: waking up whenever, using my dual-monitor mac, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davetron5000/tags/rudy">Rudy</a> close by.  My first day was a net win, despite having to bring in my own computer, and overall I'm not complaining because I get to use a Mac at work <B>thank GOD</b>.
</p>
<p>
Pluses so far:
<ul>
<li>Smart people I can have a conversation with</li>
<li>Meaningful product (i.e. not another CRUD app for a government agency [not that there's anything wrong with it])</li>
<li>Not only have they heard of javadoc, they use it!</li>
<li>Database migrations!</li>
<li>Clean looking code and tests that actually pass on a fresh checkout!</li>
<li>No M$ exchange server or other shitbox mail system (they use Google Apps)</li>
<li>Damn close to home; I should be biking in real soon</li>
<li>Relaxed environment</li>
<li>I'm one person away from a bonafide window with the shades open!</li>
</ul>
Honestly, it's almost a 100% on my <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/daveblog5000/?p=47">interview rubric</a> (which I took down for a while, because some HR person read it and gave me shit about not liking having a dress code.  I mean, does <b>anyone</b> <b>really</b> like putting on a suit and tie to site and write code?  Or to do anything?  We're talking levels of tolerance, and mine is low, mostly because I believe dress codes indicate a deeper organizational problem of priority management).  
</p>
<p>
Negatives so far:
<ul>
<li>Kinda noisy office (fortunately few people seem to have phones)</li>
<li>Subversion (it looks like they aren't going nuts with branches, so <tt>git-svn</tt> should preserve my sanity in this regard)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
On the fence so far:
<ul>
<li>Maven - The only reason this isn't a negative is that it's better than the pile of shit ant script everyone else uses, and the build <b>does</b> work pretty painlessly.</li>
<li>Spring - I haven't used Spring for anything real, and I can't say it gets me excited (nor have I ever thought it sounded all that great), but I'm optimistic about it.  I figure if it, in fact, is great, I'm happy. If it sucks, I have fodder for ranting.  It's a win/win.  I <b>do</b> fear the XML situps tho.</li> 
</ul>
