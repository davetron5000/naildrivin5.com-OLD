Brief follow up to my [A real keyboard for programmers](http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/08/29/a-real-keyboard-for-programmers.html) post, I got a
[Chromebook](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/) yesterday and the keyboard, while sporting the same layout as most other computers, actually
is better designed for what the Chromebook does.

Namely, it has no function keys, instead using them for browser navigation, window management, and hardware controls.  Most amazingly, though, it has no
Caps Lock, instead making it a Search key, which makes sense.  It's a big key in a very prominent spot and Search is what Google wants you to do.
