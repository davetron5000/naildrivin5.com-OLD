New post by yours truly on the [Stitch Fix Tech Blog][techblog] about some handy abilities and skills a start-up tech team needs to succeed: [Startup Engineering Team Super Powers][post]:

> So far, we’ve been able to avoid creating a single monolithic application, and have been consistently delivering and deploying solutions to our users. I believe this is because we’ve developed a set of “super powers” which have been extremely helpful, and I believe these powers will keep our team and technology healthy for years to come.
