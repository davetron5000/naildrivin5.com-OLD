<div class="entry-content"><p>Today is my first official day<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> a <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a>, where I&#8217;ll be joining the small but awesome engineering team!  What I love about Stitch Fix is that it&#8217;s such a simple business: buy clothes for one price, sell them at a higher price.  It&#8217;s the very essence of what a business does.  &#8220;All&#8221; we have to do is find more people to buy things from us, figure out what they want to buy, and sell to them as efficiently as possible.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I got an overview of their operations, and it&#8217;s amazing how well the business seems to work with almost no real automation (which is where the engineering team comes in).  This sort of thing - writing software to make other people&#8217;s jobs vastly simpler - is what I love about programming.  It reminds me of a particular user of the software I was writing for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service">US Marshals Service</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;d been there well over a year, and our requirements came from the government&#8217;s technical project manager.  He was an old timer,
knew the business, and gathered new requirements and features from the users (who were a wide variety of cops, administrators,
and other IT people).  But now, we were getting to meet some real users in a real district office.  We talked to a lot of
different people about how they used the software and, more importantly, what they did at their jobs.</p>

<p>Learning about Stitch Fix&#8217;s operations made me think of one person in particular from this trip.  Her team handled transporting
prisoners from jail to court - when a prisoner&#8217;s court date arrived, the Marshals had to make sure he was in a bus that morning
headed to the courthouse from jail.  Part of this woman&#8217;s job was to assemble that list on paper and hand it to the deputies in
charge of prisoner transport.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there was no specific feature in the software to generate and print this list.  What she did instead was to call
up the list on screen via a custom query.  This was a VT100 app, so only about 20 prisoners were viewable on the screen at a
time.  She would then <em>print the screen</em>, and scroll to the next page, repeating this printing until she got the entire list.
The result was a stack of papers with 80x24 screenshots printed on them.</p>

<p><em>And then</em> she would <em>cut out the list</em> from each piece of paper before finally <em>taping the lists together</em> and copying it to
hand off to the deputy.  It took her well over an hour each day.  And she wasn&#8217;t the only one doing this - it was the simplest
way to assemble this list.</p>

<p>My colleagues and I were <em>begging</em> to fix this.  It would&#8217;ve taken one of us <em>maybe</em> a day to fully implement, fully test, and
deploy a report that would simply print out the list.  But, it wasn&#8217;t a priority on the project plan, so it never got done. This
was <em>years</em> ago, so I hope this poor woman has retired or that <em>someone</em> has fixed this.</p>

<p>At Stitch Fix, I&#8217;m looking forward to actually <em>solving</em> these sorts of problems.  These really are the reason software is so great - minimal effort &#8220;typing shit into the computer&#8221; can save <em>days</em> for someone else.  Sometimes I think my job is to eliminate the need for tape and scissors.</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
  <img class="left" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ae52d95bbc43d0a62044a9a6b5674de0.png">
  I'm a programmer, musician, and <a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">author</a>.  I speak frequently at national and regional conferences and spend my days currently as a lead engineer at <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a>. I've written applications in C, C++, Perl, Ruby, Scala, and many others, on large and small teams. As a developer, I believe in clean code, making it right, providing a great user experience and using the right tool for the job.  As a bass player, I believe in using a pick, locking it down, and ripping off Peter Hook.  As an author, I insist on the Oxford Comma, try to avoid semi-colons, and dislike title case.
