            <p>Over on <a href="http://technology.stitchfix.com/blog">Stitch Fix&#39;s engineering blog</a>, I wrote a <a href="http://technology.stitchfix.com/blog/2014/07/02/how-we-deal-with-failing-resque-jobs/">new post</a> on how we deal with tricky job failures.
Namely, make your jobs idempotent:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trapping <code>Resque::TermException</code> is really just kicking the can down the road. You might prevent some of your jobs from failing, but you&#39;ll still get failed jobs. Granted, they will fail at a lower rate, but it&#39;s still a rate correlated to the scale of your business.</p>

<p>The underlying problem is that jobs aren&#39;t <strong>idempotent</strong>.</p>

Let&#39;s forget about that word and just talk about types.</p>

<p>What do we mean by <em>types</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Types are everywhere, they are all around us, even now in your very programs. You can see them when you look at your browser, or when you start up your editor. You can feel them when you go to work, when you go to meetups, when you buy your conference passes. </p>

<p>Morpheus is correct, types are at the absolute core of every program we write, &quot;static&quot; or not.</p>

            <p>In reading &quot;The Swift Programming Language&quot; to prep for my <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2014/06/04/what-swift-tells-use-about-programming-language-trends.html">post on how Swift informs us about programming language trends</a>, I was surprised at how straightforward the language&#39;s features seemed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found myself nodding along with each feature introduced. Tuples: check. Named Parameters: check. Default Parameters: check. Protocols: check. Functions: check. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realized it wasn&#39;t just because Swift has unsurprising features, but because I&#39;m familiar enough with enough other languages
that I&#39;ve experienced or used those features before.  Although I write mainly in Ruby and JavaScript at work, I have a lot of
experience with Java and C, and had my head was in Scala for quite a while a few years ago.</p>

<p>Although the forms of Swift&#39;s various features differ from their analogs in other languages, conceptually, they are the same: the
generic type system is similar to Java&#39;s, and the tuples are close enough to Scala&#39;s that all I need to do is understand the
syntax.</p>

<p>It really is true that the more languages you know, the easier it is to &quot;pick up&quot; new ones.  This is a <em>great</em> reason to 
<a href="http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">learn a new programming language every year</a>.</p>

<p>If all you know are dynamic languages like Ruby or JavaScript<a name="back-1"></a><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, or you are only familiar with Java or C#, you are increasingly at
a disadvantage when trying to acquire new skills.  Learning something like Swift (or Scala, or Elixir, or whatever) requires not
just understanding the syntax of the language, but the very <em>concepts</em> that underpin its features (some of which can be mind-bending).</p>

<sup>1</sup><strong>Particularly</strong> JavaScript.  It has probably the <em>least</em> features of any modern programming language. If you've never experienced a truly powerful and expressive language, you will be more and more behind as the industry moves on. JavaScript won't go away, but it's becoming assembly language.

This is a rare event for us programmers, as we don&#39;t often get to see what the biggest technology company on the planet (who
owns one of the biggest platforms on the planet) thinks about programming language design.</p>

<p>Swift embodies two major themes in programming language design that have come to the forefront in the last several years:
functions as first-class values (a given, these days), and, more surprisingly, static typing.</p>

<p><a href="http://growingdevs.com/stop-using-rubygems-and-start-using-bower.html">Use Bower for managing front-end assets in Rails</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rails 4.0.4 depends on version 2.2.x of the jquery-rails gem which in turn bundles 1.9.1 of JQuery. Does that make any sense? The latest official release of angular-ui-bootstrap-rails is 0.9.0, which is at least a version behind the current release of the Angular UI bootstrap directives. When will it be updated? chosen-rails version 1.1.0 bundles an old version of chosen-jquery that has never been officially released. What?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The state of front-end assets in RubyGems is almost comical.  Please start using Bower.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been doing a bit of <a href="http://angularjs.com">AngularJS</a> at work, and getting it all working with Rails, the asset pipeline, testing, and deployment was quite a
challenge.  It wasn&#39;t so much difficult to do, but difficult to uncover the right information.  So, I decided to compile it all in a nice tutorial and post it as a free mini-ebook, in web form, also known as a website<a name="back-1"></a><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://angular-rails.com">angular-rails.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Once you're familiar enough with Angular to start building an app, you'll find there are a lot of unanswered questions:
<ul>
<li>How do I serve Angular assets via the Rails Asset Pipeline?</li>
<li>How does Angular's templating system work with Rails?</li>
<li>How do I connect Angular to my Rails controllers?</li>
<li>How do I test my Angular code within a Rails app?</li>
<li>How do I manage all these JavaScript dependencies?</li>
<li>What challenges will there be in the production environment not present in the development environment?</li>
</ul>
I was able to find answers by piecing together information from Stack Overflow and various blog posts. You shouldn't have to do that.
