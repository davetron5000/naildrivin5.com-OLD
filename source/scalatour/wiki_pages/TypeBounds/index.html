<h1>TypeBounds</h1>
<h2>The Gist</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/136">Upper Bounds</a> and <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/137">Lower Bounds</a> describe Scala’s support for restricting the types that can be used in a genericized class</p>
<h2>My Interpretation</h2>
<p>Just as with Java, in Scala you can put bounds on the generic types allowed to a generic class or method.</p>
<p>Suppose we have an object hierarchy of entities. We have a root entity that all must extend, and then a special secondary entity for reference data (data that is a code and a description and only aggregated by other entities).</p>
<p>Further, we wish to define a sorting class that we can apply to all reference data.</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/154920.js">
</script>
<p>We <strong>could</strong> have created the sorter class to just take <code>ReferenceData</code>, but the <code>regular</code> and <code>sorted</code> methods would not return properly typed <code>Lists</code>, they would return lists of <code>ReferenceData</code> and not, say <code>List[Gender]</code>, which would be more useful.</p>
<p>This is essentially the same concept as <code>List&lt;T extends Foo&gt;</code> that you have in java, though more concise.</p>
<p>You can also bound the other way, via <code>List[T &gt;: Foo]</code></p>
<h2>My Thoughts on this Feature</h2>
<p>Here we are going down the rabbit hole of static typing. I have found many uses for upper bounds, and almost no uses for lower bounds in Java, but I find the Scala syntax quite unpleasant. Even though it’s a few more characters, to me <code>&lt;T extends Foo&gt;</code> is just much clearer and easier to remember than <code>[T &lt;: Foo]</code>. I instantly knew what the Java version meant, but still have to look up which syntax to use for Scala.</p>
<p>Like <a href="/scalatour/wiki_pages/ScalaGenerics">ScalaGenerics</a> , you really do have to have this feature, but this is where the static types start to get confusing and muddle intent, IMO.</p>
