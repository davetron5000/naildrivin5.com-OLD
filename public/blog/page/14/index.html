<li><b>Subversion</b> - Git is so much better in so many ways (it goes without saying that CVS should be allowed to die)</li>
<li><b>JUnit</b> - TestNG does all that JUnit does and more; what does JUnit even have to offer these days?</li>
<li><b>Java 1.4</b> - Java without generics is just so much pain</li>
<li><b>Java Web Frameworks</b> - As far as I can tell, <b>none</b> of them adequately address one of the fundamental problems in web development, which is to simplify the creation of the UI.</li>
<li><b>Ant</b> - Ant has always been the world&#8217;s worst build automation language; who creates a build tool without variables, loops and conditionals?  We can do better (and Maven doesn&#8217;t appear to be it)</li>
<li><b>Checked exceptions</b> - <tt>java.lang.Exception</tt> is possibly the worst class in the Java library; should never be caught nor thrown<sup>1</sup></li>
<li><b>Misuses of XML</b> - XML has a purpose, and it&#8217;s not as a programming language or configuration file format.  Any notion that XML is anything other than a <b>binary format</b> is misguided</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><i>
<sup>1</sup>API developers should be allowed to declare that they throw <tt>Exception</tt> to allow subclasses to throw whatever they want with impunity, however <tt>Throwable</tt> is the preferred thing to catch for catch-alls, and the entire exception mechanism in Java is woefully broken.</i>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I haven&#8217;t used a code coverage tool for Java, but in my spare time I&#8217;ve been working up some Ruby code (mostly to learn the language).  I&#8217;m using Test Driven Development, which is slightly simpler with Ruby than with Java (mostly due to Ruby&#8217;s interpreted nature).
</p>
<p>
I had heard about <a href="http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov ">rcov</a> and decided to give it a shot.  Within literally <b>5 minutes</b> I had it installed and a report showing my tests were not covering all my code!  Amazing.  I could then easily see <b>exactly</b> where I need to to test and, sure enough, found some bugs that would&#8217;ve gone unnoticed.  
</p>
<p>
Even the best tool with Java would&#8217;ve required some painful ant tweaking (not to mention hopes and prayers that it worked with TestNG).  I already cannot imagine writing tests without being able to view the coverage&#8230;.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Sad to say, my time at Gliffy is at an end (:sniff:), so I&#8217;m heading back into the job pool.  I was lucky to get some time in at Gliffy, because, living in Washington, DC, my opportunities for sexy cutting-edge jobs are about zilch.  Instead, I&#8217;m facing a <b>huge</b> market of &#8220;Senior JBoss Portal Maintenance Archiect&#8221; type jobs.</p>
<p>I guess I should feel lucky that there&#8217;s lots of positions out there, but I really don&#8217;t want to be the cog in a huge machine.  Gliffy has shielded me from the Horror That Can Be Consulting, so I need to keep my perspective in such trying times.  So, calling on my experiences before Gliffy, I&#8217;ve made this handy rubric to make sure I explore all facets of a potential position.
</p>
<p>
I don&#8217;t expect anyone to get all positives and no negatives (I&#8217;ve certainly never been anywhere that perfect), bit it&#8217;s always good to know.  For example, if I have to put up with PVCS, I better be sitting on an Aeron chair and be using a normalized database.  Further, this is obviously in addition to standard questions regarding what the project is about (i.e. is it interesting) and what the people are like.  A whole lot of this can be forgiven by being part of a great team or working on a really cool product.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Time and time again, users complain about an application crashing on them or otherwise not working.  They don&#8217;t provide you any info and it&#8217;s hard to repeat.  You check out the log, but there&#8217;s thousands (or millions) of entries and you have no clue where their error occured.  Worse, if you are deploying a RIA, the log  may be on their computer and not available.
</p>
<p>
On my last project we experienced this scenario so much that we instituted two things
<ul>
<li>All messages logged with <tt>Level.ERROR</tt> in log4j would be emailed to us</li>
<li>All exceptions caught on the client would be packaged and sent back to the server and logged at <tt>Level.ERROR</tt> level (thus emailing them to us</li>
</ul>
After the initial deluge of emails, we <b>found a lot of bugs</b>.  I mean <b>a lot</b> of bugs.  The annoying, intermittent kind that are hard to reproduce.  Further, by judicious use of logging, we discovered a lot of mis-configured environments and other problems without having to get users to mail us their logs.
</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.gliffy.com">Gliffy</a>, they are doing the same thing.  Right now, we&#8217;re testing a bunch of new features and the stage instance just sent me a bunch of emails, all indicating configuration problems, which is the exact kind of thing that can be hard to track down.
</p>
<p>
Setting it up using log4j is dead simple:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='java'>log4j.appender.mail=org.apache.log4j.net.SMTPAuthenticateAppender
log4j.appender.mail.SMTPHost=@SMTP_HOST@
log4j.appender.mail.UserName=@SMTP_USER@
log4j.appender.mail.Password=@SMTP_PASS@
log4j.appender.mail.Authenticate=true
log4j.appender.mail.From=errors@gliffy.com
log4j.appender.mail.To=@SMTP_LOGGER_FAILURE@
log4j.appender.mail.Subject=Errors from @SMTP_DESC@
log4j.appender.mail.BufferSize=1
log4j.appender.mail.Threshold=ERROR
log4j.appender.mail.LocationInfo=true 
log4j.appender.mail.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout 
log4j.appender.mail.layout.ConversionPattern=%d %p%n%t%n%c:%M:%L%n---%n%m%n---%n%n</code>
  </pre>
</div>


In my previous job I even created a customized layout to format the emails in such a way that our code was highlighted and GMail didn&#8217;t compress things into threads.
</p>
<p>
If you aren&#8217;t doing this, you should be.  Now.

  <div class="entry-content">Been playing with <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a> lately and decided to use it to package up the PHP Client Library for the <a href="http://www.gliffy.com">Gliffy</a> <a href="http://jira.gliffy.com/browse/GLIFFY-775">integration API</a>.  Didn&#8217;t seem to make sense to use ant for something that amounts to creating a tarball.  <tt>make</tt> would be appropriate here, too, but I figured it would be cool to use Rake and there&#8217;s not really much harm in doing so.

A large annoyance is <tt>Rake::PackageTask</tt>.  This is a seemingly handy task that creates tars, zips, etc. and is pretty useful.  It&#8217;s not a task in and of itself, but it creates the <tt>:package</tt> task:

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>Rake::PackageTask.new(&quot;gliffy-php-client&quot;,GLIFFY_VERSION) do |p|
    p.need_tar = true
    p.need_zip = true
    p.package_files = SRC_FILES + EXAMPLE_FILES + DOC_FILES
end</code>
  </pre>
</div>


Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t do what it seems to do.  <tt>DOC_FILES</tt> is the list of documentation files output by <a href="http://www.phpdoc.org/">phpDocumentor</a> and are not checked into version control.  The syntax of the <tt>PackageTask</tt> makes it appear that the code in the block will run when the <tt>:package</tt> task executes, however this is not the case.  This code is initialization code.  So, I tried:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'># DOC_DIR is the dir generated by phpdoc, a task elsewhere
# uses this to kick off phpdoc
task :package =&gt; DOC_DIR</code>
  </pre>
</div>


The result is that the tarball and zip files are created and <b>then</b> the documentation is generated.  The reason is that <tt>PackageTask.new</tt> creates a set of tasks and the actual creation of the tarball/zip file is done via a <tt>file</tt> task, upon which <tt>:package</tt> is dependent.  So, the real dependency I created was:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>task :package =&gt; &quot;gliffy-php-client.zip&quot; &quot;gliffy-php-client.tgz&quot; DOC_DIR</code>
  </pre>
</div>


Examining the source code, a task named for the directory created by <tt>:package</tt> is created.  This task is dependent on the <tt>package_files</tt> set up in the constructor.  So <b>this</b> is the task I need to use:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'># Have to keep a reference to the PackageTask object
package_task = Rake::PackageTask.new(&quot;gliffy-php-client&quot;,GLIFFY_VERSION) do |p|
    p.need_tar = true
    p.need_zip = true
    # Executed BEFORE any other tasks; DOC_FILES don't exist  yet
    p.package_files = SRC_FILES + EXAMPLE_FILES
end

file package_task.package_dir_path =&gt; DOC_DIR

file DOC_DIR =&gt; SRC_FILES + EXAMPLE_FILES do |t|
    system(&quot;phpdoc #{PHP_DOC_ARGS}&quot;);
    doc_files = FileList.new(DOC_DIR + &quot;/**/**&quot;);
    # Have to add these files to the package_task file list
    package_task.package_files = package_task.package_files + doc_files
end</code>
  </pre>
</div>


This is definitely a hack, because I&#8217;m depending on the internal implementation of the <tt>PackageTask</tt>.  It really needs a facility for including generated files.  In <tt>make</tt>, I could just send the directory <tt>DOC_DIR</tt> to <tt>tar</tt> and it would pick up everything.  In Ant, I&#8217;d probably have to spawn another ant, since ant sets all property vaules at startup time.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I currently host <a href="http://vimdoclet.sf.net">my Vim Javadoc doclet</a> on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> and <b>every</b> time I have to deal with it, it&#8217;s just a monumental pain.  The documentation is insanely long and detailed, the website looks horribly out of date and cruddy, and when compared to stuff like <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://www.lighthouseapp.com">Lighthouse</a>, it&#8217;s almost embarrassing how difficult it is to deal with and how bad the UI is (despite my best efforts, it <b>still</b> insists that the featured download is the vimdoc samples and not the doclet itself.  WTF?).
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m already hosting the code in GitHub and just moved my tickets to Lighthouse.  The only thing left is where to host binary downloads and static assets.  For <a href="http://www.googlecode.com/p/restunit">RESTUnit</a>, I&#8217;m using <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a>, which is pretty easy to deal with (about a zillion times simpler and easier than SourceForge), however it has no facility for hosting arbitrary HTML.  Currently, I&#8217;m just using my website for static assets.
</p>
<p>
While I do like the new Web-2.0 way of doing things (one site like GitHub really focusing on source, another like Lighthouse just does ticketing, etc. and they integrate via web services), I&#8217;m not sure where the best place is to host downloads and static assets.  I would need programmatic access and some liberal download/diskspace quotas for sure.  It would also be nice to be able to connect to other services, for example generate a changelog based on commits or tickets closed since the last release.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my reply to <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/09/10/Misusing-RSpec">a post on Tim Bray&#8217;s blog</a> about using RSpec for testing REST services, I briefly described a project I&#8217;m working on, based on the work I&#8217;ve been doing at <a href="http://www.gliffy.com">Gliffy</a>, which is a testing framework for REST services called, unsurprisingly, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/restunit/">RestUNIT</a>.
</p>
<p>
For Gliffy&#8217;s REST-based <a href="http://jira.gliffy.com/browse/GLIFFY-775">integration API</a>, I needed a way to test it, and hand-coding test cases using <a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/">HTTPClient</a> was just not going to cut it.  Further, requests to Gliffy&#8217;s API require signing (similar to how Flickr does it), and our API was going to support multiple ways of specifying the representation type as well as tunneling over POST.
</p>
<p>
So, it occured to me that there was a lazier way of doing this testing.  All I really needed to specify was the relative URL, parameters, headers, method, and expected response.  Someone else could do the signing and re-run the tests with the various options (such as specifying the MIME Type via the <tt>Accept:</tt> header, and then again via a file extension in the URL).</p>
<p>
I ended up creating a bunch of text files with this information.  I then used a Ruby script to generate two things:  an XML file that could be deserialized into a java object useful for testing, and a PHP script to test our PHP client API.
</p>
<p>
The Ruby script would also do things like calculate the signature (the test text files contained the api and secret keys a Gliffy user would have to use the API) and generate some derivative tests (e.g. one using a <tt>DELETE</tt>, and another tunneling that over <tt>POST</tt>).  The testing engine could generate some additional derivative tests (e.g. GET requests should respond to conditional gets if the server sent back an <tt>ETag</tt> or <tt>Last-Modified</tt> header).  All this then runs as a <a href="http://testng.org">TestNG</a> test.  
</p>
<p>
The whole thing works well, but is pretty hackish.  So, RestUNIT was created as a fresh codebase to create a more stable and useful testing engine.  My hope is to specify tests as YAML or some other human-readable markup, instead of XML (which is essentially binary for any real-sized data) and to allow for more sophisticated means of comparing results, deriving tests, and running outside a container (all the Gliffy tests require a specific data set and run in-container).
</p>
<p>
</p>
The test specification format should then be usable to generate tests in any other language (like I did with PHP).  I&#8217;m working on this slowly in my spare time and trying to keep the code clean and the architecture extensible, but not overly complex.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I&#8217;m currently working the <a href="http://jira.gliffy.com/browse/GLIFFY-775">integration API</a> for <a href="//www.gliffy.com">Gliffy</a>, which is a REST-based service.  The API is fairly stable and we&#8217;re readying a few ancillary things for release.  One of those is the documentation for the API.  I found it quite difficult to completely describe the REST services and ultimately  ended up creating something that lists out &#8220;objects&#8221; and &#8220;methods&#8221;, even though the API is not really object-based.  For example, the object &#8220;Diagram&#8221; has a &#8220;method&#8221; called &#8220;list&#8221;; to &#8220;call&#8221; it, you do an HTTP <tt>GET</tt> to <tt>accounts/<i>your account name</i>/diagrams</tt>. 
</p>
<p>The original spec I created to work against (and thus, our initial draft of API documentation) was basically a list of URLs and the HTTP methods they responded to.  Not very easy to navigate or understand on a first sitting.  Some sort of schema to describe the REST API would have been really helpful (along the lines of an XML Schema).  Such a schema could facilitate documentation, testing, code generation.
</p>
<p>
As an example, consider some features of the Gliffy API: you can list the users in an account, list the diagrams in an account and reference an individual diagram via id.  Here&#8217;s a YAML-esque description of these services:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='yaml'>&lt;b&gt;accounts:&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;kind:&lt;/b&gt; literal
  &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Reference to all accounts&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;POST:&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Creates a new account&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;parameters:&lt;/b&gt;
        - account_name
            &lt;b&gt;required:&lt;/b&gt; true
            &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Name of the account you want to create&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
        - admin_email
            &lt;b&gt;required:&lt;/b&gt; true
            &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Email address of an administrator for the new account&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;children:&lt;/b&gt;
     &lt;b&gt;account_name:&lt;/b&gt;
       &lt;b&gt;kind:&lt;/b&gt; variable
       &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;The name of your account&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
       &lt;b&gt;GET:&lt;/b&gt;
         &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Returns meta-data about the account&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
         &lt;b&gt;parameters:&lt;/b&gt;
            - show_users
              &lt;b&gt;required:&lt;/b&gt; false
              &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;If true, users are included, if false, they are not&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
       &lt;b&gt;children:&lt;/b&gt;
         &lt;b&gt;diagrams:&lt;/b&gt;
           &lt;b&gt;kind:&lt;/b&gt; literal
           &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;All diagrams in the account&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
           &lt;b&gt;POST:&lt;/b&gt;
             &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Creates a new diagram&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
             &lt;b&gt;parameters:&lt;/b&gt;
               - diagram_name
                 &lt;b&gt;required:&lt;/b&gt; true
                 &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Desired name for this diagram&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
               - template_id
                 &lt;b&gt;required:&lt;/b&gt; false
                 &lt;b&gt;type:&lt;/b&gt; numeric
                 &lt;b&gt;dsec:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;If present, the id of the diagram to copy, instead of using the blank one&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
           &lt;b&gt;GET:&lt;/b&gt;
             &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Gets a list of all diagrams in this account&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
           &lt;b&gt;children:&lt;/b&gt;
             &lt;b&gt;id:&lt;/b&gt;
               &lt;b&gt;kind:&lt;/b&gt; variable
               &lt;b&gt;type:&lt;/b&gt; numeric
               desc &lt;i&gt;&quot;The id of a particular diagram&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
               &lt;b&gt;GET:&lt;/b&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Gets the diagram; the requested encoding type will determine the form&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;parameters:&lt;/b&gt;
                   - &lt;b&gt;version:&lt;/b&gt; 
                     &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;The version to get, 1 is the original version.  If omitted, current version is retrieved&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
                     &lt;b&gt;required:&lt;/b&gt; false
                     &lt;b&gt;type:&lt;/b&gt; numeric
                   - &lt;b&gt;size:&lt;/b&gt;
                     &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;For rastered formats, determins the size
                     &lt;b&gt;type:&lt;/b&gt; enumeration
                       - L
                       - M
                       - S
               &lt;b&gt;DELETE:&lt;/b&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Deletes this image&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
          &lt;b&gt;users:&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;kind:&lt;/b&gt; literal
            &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;All users in the account&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;GET:&lt;/b&gt;
              &lt;b&gt;desc:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;gets a list of all users in the account&quot;&lt;/i&gt;</code>
  </pre>
</div>

Since &#8220;accounts&#8221; is the only top-level element, we are saying that every request to this service must start with <tt>accounts/</tt>.  It has one child, which is a variable value for the account name.  It is untyped, so any potential string is allowed.  <b>That element</b> has two possible children: <tt>diagrams</tt> and <tt>users</tt>.  <tt>diagrams</tt> indicates that it responds to the HTTP methods <tt>POST</tt> and <tt>GET</tt>.  A <tt>POST</tt> requires the parameter <tt>diagram_name</tt>, while the parameter <tt>version</tt> is optional.
</p>
<p>
A standard format like this could easily be used to generate documentation, expectations, test cases,  and even stub code.   This format could even be delivered by an <tt>OPTIONS</tt> call to a resource.  I realize there is not much standardization around how to design and implement a REST service, but something like this could at least be a stake in the ground and support a specific method.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><i>Following on from <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/blog/2008/09/09/testing-gliffy-without-testers/">my post on Gliffy&#8217;s blog&#8230;</a></i></p>
<p>
On more than a few occasions, I&#8217;ve been faced with making significant refactorings to an existing application.   These are things where we need to overhaul an architectural component without breaking anything, or changing the application&#8217;s features.  For an applicaiton without any test cases, this is not only scary, but ill-advised.  </p>
<p>
I believe this is the primary reason that development shops hang on to out-dated technology.  I got a job at a web development shop after <b>four</b> years of doing nothing but Swing and J2EE.  My last experience with Java web development was Servlets, JSPs and taglibs.  This company was <b>still</b> using these as the primary components of their architecture.  No Struts, no Spring, no SEAM.  Why?  One reason was that they had <b>no</b> test infrastructure and therefore <b>not</b> ability to refactor anything.
</p>
<h3>Doing it anyway</h3>
<p>
Nevertheless, sometimes the benefits outweigh the costs and you <b>really</b> need to make a change.  At <a href="http://www.gliffy.com">Gliffy</a>, I was hired to create an API to integrate editing Gliffy diagrams into the workflow of other applications.  After a review of their code and architecture, the principals and I decided that the database layer needed an overhaul.  It was using JDBC/SQL and had become difficult to change (especially to the new guy: me).  I suggested moving to the  <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/daveblog5000/?tag=jpa">Java Persistence Architecture</a> (backed by Hibernate), and they agreed.  Only problem was how to make sure I didn&#8217;t break anything.  They didn&#8217;t have automated tests, and I was totally new to the application environment.
</p>
<p>
They <b>did</b> have test scripts for testers to follow that would hit various parts of the application.  Coming from my previous enviornment, that in and of itself was amazing.  Since the application communicates with the server entirely via <tt>HTTP POST</tt>, and recieves mostly XML back, I figured I could manually execute the tests and record them in a way so they could be played back later as regression tests. 
</p>
<h3>Recording Tests</h3>
<p>
This is suprisingly easy thanks to the filtering features of the Servlet specification:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='java'>&lt;filter&gt;
  &lt;filter-name&gt;recorder&lt;/filter-name&gt;
  &lt;filter-class&gt;com.gliffy.test.online.RecordServletFilter&lt;/filter-class&gt;
&lt;/filter&gt;

&lt;!-- ... --&gt;

&lt;filter-mapping&gt;
  &lt;filter-name&gt;recorder&lt;/filter-name&gt;
  &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/filter-mapping&gt;</code>
  </pre>
</div>


The filter code is bit more complex, because I had to create proxy classes for <tt>HttpServletRequest</tt> and <tt>HttpServletResponse</tt>.  Here&#8217;s an overview of how everything fits together:
<a href="http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/1487626/L.jpg"><img src="http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/1487626/S.jpg" border=0></a>
</p>
<p>The request proxy had to read everything from the requests input stream, save it, and send a new stream that would output the same data to the caller.  It had to do the same thing with the <tt>Reader</tt>.  I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s an error to use both in the same request, and Gliffy&#8217;s code didn&#8217;t do that, so this worked well.
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='java'>private class RecordingServletRequest extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequestWrapper
{
    BufferedReader reader = null;
    ServletInputStream inputStream = null;

    String readerContent = null;
    byte inputStreamContent[] = null;

    public RecordingServletRequest(HttpServletRequest r) { super(r); }

    public BufferedReader getReader()
        throws IOException
    {
        if (reader == null)
        {
            StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
            BufferedReader superReader = super.getReader();
            int ch = superReader.read();
            while (ch != -1)
            {
                writer.write(ch);
                ch = superReader.read();
            }
            readerContent = writer.toString();
            return new BufferedReader(new StringReader(readerContent));
        }
        return reader;
    }

    public ServletInputStream getInputStream()
        throws IOException
    {
        if (inputStream == null)
        {
            ByteArrayOutputStream os = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
            ServletInputStream superInputStream = super.getInputStream();
            int b = superInputStream.read();
            while (b != -1)
            {
                os.write(b);
                b = superInputStream.read();
            }
            inputStreamContent = os.toByteArray();
            inputStream = new ByteArrayServletInputStream(inputStreamContent);
        }
        return inputStream;
    }
}</code>
  </pre>
</div>

</p>
<p>
The response recorder was a bit trickier,  because I needed to save things like status codes and content types.  This implementation probably wouldn&#8217;t work for all clients (for example, it ignores any response headers), but since Gliffy is an OpenLaszlo app, and OpenLaszlo has almost <b>no</b> view into HTTP, this worked well for our purposes.  Again, I had to wrap the <tt>OutputStream</tt>/<tt>Writer</tt> so I could record what was being sent back.
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='java'>private class RecordingServletResponse extends HttpServletResponseWrapper
{
    public RecordingServletResponse(HttpServletResponse r)
    {
        super(r);
    }

    int statusCode;
    StringWriter stringWriter = null;
    ByteArrayOutputStream byteOutputStream = null;
    String contentType = null;

    private PrintWriter writer = null;
    private ServletOutputStream outputStream = null;

    public ServletOutputStream getOutputStream()
        throws IOException
    {
        if (outputStream == null)
        {
            byteOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
            outputStream = new RecordingServletOutputStream(super.getOutputStream(),new PrintStream(byteOutputStream));
        }
        return outputStream;
    }

    public PrintWriter getWriter()
        throws IOException
    {
        if (writer == null)

<p>
The filter then needs to use this and inject them into the actual servlet calls:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='java'>public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
    throws IOException, ServletException
{
    RecordingServletRequest recordingRequest = 
      new RecordingServletRequest((HttpServletRequest)request);
    RecordingServletResponse recordingResponse = 
      new RecordingServletResponse((HttpServletResponse)response);

    chain.doFilter(recordingRequest,recordingResponse);</code>
  </pre>
</div>

After the call to <tt>doFilter</tt>, we can then examine the proxy request/respons and record the test.  I&#8217;ll spare you 20 lines of <tt>setXXX</tt> methods.  I created a Java bean class and used XStream to serialize it.  I then created another class that runs as a TestNG test to deserialize these files and make the same requests.  I record the response and see if it matches.
</p>
<h3>Running the Tests</h3>
<p>
There were a few problems with this approach:
<ul>
<li>The tests required certain test data to exist</li>
<li>Each test potentially modifies the database, meaning the tests have to be run in the order they were created.</li>
<li>The test results had temporal data in them that, while irrelevant to the tests &#8220;passing&#8221;, complicated exact-match comparisions of results</li>
</ul>
TestNG (and JUnit) are not really designed for this; they are more for proper <i>unit</i> testing, where each test can be run indepedent of the others and the results compared.  While there are facilities for setting up test data and cleaning up, the idea of resetting the database before each of the 300 tests I would record was not appealing.  Faking/mocking the database was not an option; I was creating these tests specifically to make sure my changes to the database layer were not causing regressions.  I needed to test against a real database.
</p>
<p>
I ultimately decided to group my tests into logical areas, and ensure that: a) tests were run in a predictable order, and b) the first test of a group was run against a known dataset.  I created a small, but useful, test dataset and created a TestNG test that would do both (a) and (b).  It wasn&#8217;t pretty, but it worked.  This clearly isn&#8217;t the way a unit test framework should be used, and  I would call these sorts of tests <i>functional</i>, rather than <i>unit</i>.  But, since our CI system requires JUnit test results as output, and the JUnit format isn&#8217;t documented, might as well use TestNG to handle it for me.
</p>
<p>
The last problem was making accurate comparisons of results.  I <b>did not</b> want to have to parse the XML returned by the server.  I settled on some regular expressions that stripped out temporal and transient data not relevant to the test.   Both the expected and received content were run through this regexp filter and <b>those</b> results were compared.  Parsing the XML might result in better failure messages (right now I have to do a visual diff, which is a pain), but I wasn&#8217;t convinced that the existing XML diff tools were that useful.
</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
Overall, it worked out great.  I was able to completely overhaul the database layer, and the Gliffy client was none the wiser.  We were even able to use these tests to remove our dependence on Struts, simplifying the application&#8217;s deployment (we weren&#8217;t using many features of Struts anyway).  The final validation of these tests actually came recently, when we realized a join table needed to be exposed to our server-side code.  This was a major change in two key data container, and the recorded tests were crucial to finding bugs this introduced.
</p>
<p>
So, if you don&#8217;t have the luxury of automated tests, you can always create them.  I did a similar thing with EJB3 using the <tt>Interceptors</tt> concept.

  <div class="entry-content">I used to never back up.  Well, I&#8217;d throw some iTunes songs on a DVD every once in a while, but that&#8217;s about it.  Then, I started doing some pro audio work for friend&#8217;s bands and figured it was time to get serious.  My home computer, though, never really got the treatment.  When I upgraded to Leopard, I reformatted an external drive for Time Machine, but I wanted to have something better, as a double-check on Time Machine.  So, I did what I do for pro audio, which is to get a Firewire drive the exact size of my main drive, and use <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">Super Duper!</a> to mirror the drive every night, leaving the resulting drive bootable.  A plain <tt>rsync</tt> won&#8217;t work, for some reason; the drive gets duped, but isn&#8217;t bootable.

So, last night, I made the mistake of putting an old CD-R with a sticker on it into my slot-loading iMac (my main computer).  Now, Apple needs to <b>abandon this god-forsaken idiotic design decision</b> that is literally designed to play <b>Russian roulette</b> every time you stick a disc in.  The one thing I will give Windows over Mac: when you put a disc in a Windows box, you have a 100% chance of getting back out (and a 99% chance that doing will result in a bootable computer).  Well, this disc wouldn&#8217;t mount and wouldn&#8217;t eject.  A reboot of my computer resulted in&#8230;nothing.  Gray screen forever.  FUCK YOU APPLE.  Would it really have been so bad to have a button?  A tray that sticks out?  Ugh.  So, now I have to take my iMac to the Apple store to <b>pray to Jobs</b> that they can get the CD out.  Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve got work to do.

So, I grab my Macbook Pro that I use for Pro Audio, plug in my trusty firewire mirror drive, boot and&#8230;viola!  It&#8217;s like I never left?  Thankfully, the only thing I&#8217;ve done on my computer today was check email and surf the web and since those things are, you know, still on the Internet, I&#8217;m back.  I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to sync things back up when I get my box back, but I am thanking GOD right now that I do nightly backups (and that I have another computer to fall back on).  I guess when working from home, it&#8217;s good to have a spare.

I speak frequently at national and regional conferences and spend my days currently as a lead engineer at <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a>. I&#8217;ve written applications in C, C++, Perl, Ruby, Scala, and many others, on large and small teams. As a developer, I believe in clean code, making it right, providing a great user experience and using the right tool for the job.  As a bass player, I believe in using a pick, locking it down, and ripping off Peter Hook.  As an author, I insist on the Oxford Comma, try to avoid semi-colons, and dislike title case.
