<div class="entry-content"><p>Friday was my last day at LivingSocial.  I&#8217;m moving on to a small team at a small startup that I hope will eventually be big.  My tenure at LivingSocial was short - it would&#8217;ve certainly been longer had this opportunity not come along - but I learned a lot in the 14 months I worked there.</p>

<p>Sure, I learned stuff about Rails, Ruby, service-oriented architectures, asynchronous processing, and credit card payments.  But
that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m talking about.  Those skills are great experience and will look just fine on my resume, but I learned two
things that made me a better developer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deliver results, not promises</li>
<li>Assume <em>everyone</em> knows what they&#8217;re doing</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<h2>Deliver Results, not promises</h2>

<p>At a previous job, we had a well-tuned agile process.  We worked in sprints, with a backlog, stories, and regular releases.  After a while, however, it felt like the team was just producing story points.  Products in development were allowed to be &#8220;in progress&#8221; for weeks or months.  It got to the point where progress itself was a deliverable.</p>

<p>The problem is that promises, plans, and progress reports aren&#8217;t valuable in and of themselves.  Promises don&#8217;t solve business
problems.  Customers don&#8217;t purchase progress reports, and developers can&#8217;t ship code based on un-executed plans.  For whatever
reason, LivingSocial gets this, and gets it deeply.  When Mark Zuckerburg <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a2109a54-4d88-11e1-b96c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2JHe6EgfY">told Facebook&#8217;s shareholders</a> that &#8220;code wins arguments&#8221;,
I believe this is what he meant.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='You&#8217;re going to ship smaller features and you&#8217;re going to ship them more quickly. '>
This cultural value leads to what I believe is the true essence of the &#8220;agile&#8221; movement.  Consider for a moment if <em>all</em> you are
as a developer is what you&#8217;ve shipped<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.  This is going to fundamentally change how you work. You&#8217;re going to ship smaller features and you&#8217;re going to ship them more quickly.  You&#8217;re going to deliver value to the business as quickly and frequently as possible.
</span></p>

<p>Because of this, big projects - which is a project that might take more than a couple months - are unusual at LivingSocial and cause a fair amount of trepidation.  In general, I believe this is a good thing.  Big projects have a way of not shipping.  Big projects have a way of getting bigger and more expensive.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying that big projects are bad or that LivingSocial is incapable of taking on big projects, but we always ask ourselves
if there&#8217;s a way to do a lot less a lot more quickly, and if we can start showing results sooner.  This has not been a common attitude in anywhere else I&#8217;ve worked.</p>

<p>If your organization is truly &#8220;results-oriented&#8221;, then it means that promises, planning, and status reports are treated as
fundamentally different things than shipped product.  This isn&#8217;t to say that planning and progress are bad - LivingSocial
certainly uses a wide variety of project management tools and techniques - but they are only valuable to the extent that they
enable the delivery of results.</p>

<p>This attitude quickly affected everything I did, even down to the way I&#8217;d write email. I stopped immediately responding with &#8220;I&#8217;ll look into it&#8221;, or &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure&#8221;, or &#8220;That should be correct&#8221;.  I started to respect the inboxes of others and responded only when I had a real result (or the name of the person who could get such a result if I could not).  I stopped delivering promises and started delivering results.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the second thing I learned.</p>

<h2>Assume <em>everyone</em> knows what they&#8217;re doing</h2>

<p>Programmers have well-earned reputations as prima-donnas.  While certainly not <em>every</em> programmer develops this arrogance and lack of respect for those who &#8220;can&#8217;t code&#8221;, it&#8217;s unfortunately common.</p>

<p>As a young developer, I was rude and disrespectful to anyone who didn&#8217;t code.  I was allowed to get away with it because I did my job<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> well and my skills were in high demand.  In my eyes, everyone was guilty until proven innocent.  I even began to apply this to other developers after seeing what government contractors are allowed to get away with.</p>

<p>During my job <em>prior</em> to LivingSocial, I matured a lot in this area.  I was fortunate to work with a great team of developers and with a largely effective, helpful, and talented team of sales and product people.  As the company grew, however, my old attitude crept back - there were just too many people to know intimately, and I started to treat everyone new as incompetent until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>When I started at LivingSocial, this attitude persisted.  The company is huge and, as one of only two developers working on a key
piece of infrastructure, I had to interact with a wide variety of people.  I knew enough to be nice and to be polite, but this
was initially a mask of my lingering bad attitude.</p>

<p>After a while, I started to notice that the stereotypical programmer attitude was not <em>nearly</em> as strong at LivingSocial as anywhere else I had worked.  The relationships between the developers and every other part of the company - customer service, IT, product, accounting - were far healthier than I&#8217;d ever experienced.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='everyone&#8217;s default assumption was that every member of the team was skilled, useful, and dependable '>
The result was a high functioning team that made decisions rationally, not politically.  Developers were not rude nor disrespectful to their &#8220;non-techie&#8221; counterparts, and, surprise surprise, were treated with respect themselves.  I don&#8217;t know how this evolved, but it seemed that everyone&#8217;s default assumption was that every member of the team was skilled, useful, and dependable - innocent until proven guilty.
</span></p>

<p>As I realized this, and began to adjust my attitude, it became easier and easier to work with other people.  Where in the past I would&#8217;ve dreaded having a meeting with the &#8220;idiot business guy&#8221;, I now went into these situations with an open mind, and a positive attitude - what business problem can I help solve?  Turns out that people who don&#8217;t code are pretty smart and know stuff I don&#8217;t. The end result was that, in any discussion, the best idea would almost always win (and it wasn&#8217;t necessarily the developer&#8217;s :)</p>

<p>I have no idea how to cultivate or maintain this cultural value, but when a team of developers starts with the assumption that
everyone&#8217;s working toward the same goal, and that everyone knows what they&#8217;re doing, the team functions well (and it&#8217;s a lot more
pleasant to work on such a team).</p>

<h2>Bonus third thing</h2>

<p>In July, I wrote about the <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2012/07/30/hungry-academy-graduates.html">Hungry Academy graduates</a>, who were all starting their new lives as LivingSocial developers:</p>

<blockquote><p>The first half of this grand experiment is over and it was a rousing success. The second half - how well they succeed in the actual work environment - begins now. I’m optimistic.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s been about six months since I posted that and, in that time, I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with many of the graduates.  I don&#8217;t know the ultimate cost of turning these 24 men and women into developers, but they are the most consistently skilled group of junior developers I&#8217;ve worked with.  Hiring someone with little or no experience is always a crapshoot, and you hope that even 50% of your new hires will be this good. LivingSocial was able to produce <em>twenty four</em> of them in five months.</p>

<p>And they aren&#8217;t just code monkeys.  Yes, they can make the computer do things, but their <em>attitudes</em> are amazing.  They don&#8217;t seem saddled with
any of the baggage that myself and my peers seemed to have at that point in our careers.  It gives me hope that the &#8220;prima-donna
developer&#8221; can someday be a thing of the past.  Getting to experience their growth as developers is something I won&#8217;t soon forget, and likely something that very few professional programmers will get to experience.</p>

<h2>Moving on</h2>

<p>So that&#8217;s it.  I&#8217;m moving on to work with some ex co-workers on a small team (more on that later), building a small, successful business into a larger, more successful one.  My paycheck is going to depend on delivering results, and my ability to deliver those results is going to depend on good working relationships with all sorts of people working to make this business succeed.  I honestly don&#8217;t know if this would be possible without my 14+ months at LivingSocial.</p>

<p><em>If you enjoyed this post or want to find out more about being result-oriented, I&#8217;ve written <a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">an entire book</a> on the subject called &#8220;The Senior Software Engineer&#8221;.  Pick up a copy - it&#8217;s only $25!</em></p>

  I'm a programmer, musician, and <a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">author</a>.  I speak frequently at national and regional conferences and spend my days currently as a lead engineer at <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a>. I've written applications in C, C++, Perl, Ruby, Scala, and many others, on large and small teams. As a developer, I believe in clean code, making it right, providing a great user experience and using the right tool for the job.  As a bass player, I believe in using a pick, locking it down, and ripping off Peter Hook.  As an author, I insist on the Oxford Comma, try to avoid semi-colons, and dislike title case.
