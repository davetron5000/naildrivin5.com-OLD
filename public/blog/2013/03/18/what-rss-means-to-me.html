<div class="entry-content"><p>With the recent announcement that Google is shutting down Reader, there&#8217;s been a lot of talk about RSS: Is it just a geek-only thing?  Isn&#8217;t
Twitter good enough?  Why don&#8217;t you read &#8220;real&#8221; journalists instead of blogs?</p>

<p>RSS is a huge part of my online life - every time I fire up Reeder and see stories, I get very happy.  The way I use RSS (which I believe is the best way to use it) can&#8217;t be replaced by anything else that I&#8217;m aware of.</p>

<p>So, why do I think RSS is so great?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First, I don&#8217;t use RSS readers to &#8220;discover&#8221; anything - new blogs, what people are reading, etc.  That&#8217;s what Twitter is for.  When Google
added that feature to Reader, it became <em>really</em> annoying to clear all that crap out.</p>

<p>Instead, I view my RSS feeds as a curated, frequently updated, bookshelf just for me.
I have a list of carefully selected websites whose posts I want to read <em>all</em>
of, on a daily (or more) basis.  These websites conform to the type of reading
I like - fewer, higher quality posts, as opposed to link-bait/page-view whores
like Mashable or Engadget.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying sites like Cinematical or Joystiq are worthless - there are some
great posts on there, but Twitter is sufficient to alert me to them, and I&#8217;m
rarely sad if I miss the few good posts out of the massive cruft on those
sites (I mean, do I <em>really</em> care about how many megapixels are on Sony&#8217;s
latest point-and-shoot, and do I <em>really</em> need a picture of the catering
tray at the Arrested Development shoots?).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a shame how these sites are run, because they <em>do</em> employ connected journalists who get real scoops and write great stories. But, their business models require a massive number of posts per day and so I just can&#8217;t trim the wheat from the chaff, so I don&#8217;t visit.  Not sure if I&#8217;m alone in this.</p>

<p>So, what <em>do</em> I read?  Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s in my RSS feeds.  These are the sites I
read daily and, because this is the 21st century, I don&#8217;t want to navigate to
them one by one - I want software delivering them to me, and that&#8217;s what RSS,
and a great client, do.</p>

<h2>Comics</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dilbert - duh</li>
<li>Eye on Springfield - Screencaps from the Simpsons.  Always brings a smile.</li>
<li>Joy of Tech - Nerdy, Apple-related humor</li>
<li>xkcd - double duh</li>
<li>Thrillbent/Insufferable - Mark Waid is a genius.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tech</h2>

<ul>
<li>Coding Horror - classic programming blog (that, honestly, is not as good as it was).</li>
<li>Daily WTF - duh.</li>
<li>Daring Fireball - quality writing and analysis by John Gruber about Apple and related stuff.  And plenty of snark.</li>
<li>Marco.org - by the creator of Instapaper and The Magazine, it&#8217;s like Daring Fireball Lite but with a bit more variety.</li>
<li>Michael Church&#8217;s blog (though I&#8217;ve skipped his recent <em>nine</em> treatises on workplace incompetence - he needs an editor).</li>
<li>Signal vs. Noise - 37 Signals blog isn&#8217;t as great as it used to be, but still some interesting stuff.</li>
<li>Github&#8217;s blog - Gotta keep up with one of the most amazing programmer tools ever made.</li>
<li>Giles Bowkett&#8217;s blog - insightful posts about Rails and other stuff.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Funtimes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Scott&#8217;s Blog of Doom - Pro Wrestling recaps and snark.  Yes, I like Pro Wrestling and yes, I have a sense of humor about it.</li>
<li>Wil Wheaton&#8217;s Blog - I came for his hilarious recaps of TNG episodes, I stay for his great writing, obsessive honesty and
general awesomeness.</li>
<li>Meeting Boy - daily quips from someone always stuck in a meeting.</li>
<li>Clients from Hell - daily reminder of why I don&#8217;t want to do consulting ever again.</li>
<li>Arrested Westeros - Arrested Development quotes atop Game of Thrones screencaps.  Gold.</li>
<li>Liquorious - drink recipes.  Yes, I make my own bitters and thus like reading cocktail recipes :)</li>
<li>Fashion It So - incredibly detailed fashion analysis of the costumes on Star Trek: The Next Generation.  I <em>do</em> work at a <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">fashion startup</a>, you know!</li>
</ul>


<p>What all of these have in common is that they don&#8217;t generate a lot of posts (Daring Fireball is probably the most prolific, and it&#8217;s usually just a few short link posts, with occasional long-form pieces).  The posts on these sites are almost always very high quality - I want to read them and would regret missing them.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t think of another technology besides RSS (and a great Reader client) that could more easily let me keep up with all of these websites.</p>

<h2>What makes a good reader?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m currently using <a href="http://reederapp.com">Reeder</a>, which is available on iOS and Mac and it&#8217;s more or less perfect for my needs.  It has a minimal, yet pleasing
design, full keyboard navigation (j/k or GTFO), integration with various services (namely Instapaper) and, because it uses Google Reader as a backend,
keeps me synced everywhere.  It also works great offline, assuming you&#8217;ve downloaded your feeds when you were last online.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hopeful that Reeder will come up with a new backend and just continue working.  Otherwise, I&#8217;ll be looking for new options.</p>

<p>But RSS is (I hope) <strong>far</strong> from dead.</p>

  <p>
  <img class="left" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ae52d95bbc43d0a62044a9a6b5674de0.png">
  I'm a programmer, musician, and <a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">author</a>.  I speak frequently at national and regional conferences and spend my days currently as a lead engineer at <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a>. I've written applications in C, C++, Perl, Ruby, Scala, and many others, on large and small teams. As a developer, I believe in clean code, making it right, providing a great user experience and using the right tool for the job.  As a bass player, I believe in using a pick, locking it down, and ripping off Peter Hook.  As an author, I insist on the Oxford Comma, try to avoid semi-colons, and dislike title case.
