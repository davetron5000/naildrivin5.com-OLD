<h1>XmlLiterals</h1>
<h2>The Gist</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/131">XML Processing</a> describes Scala’s native support for XML.</p>
<h2>My Interpretation</h2>
<p>Scala supports XML <strong>literals</strong>. Meaning that this program:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/154847.js">
</script>
<p>outputs this:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/154848.js">
</script>
<p>This syntax can do more than just save you a few quotes and backslashes, however. You can use curly braces to dynamically insert expressions, as such:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/154850.js">
</script>
<p>Note how we don’t quote the <code>title</code> or <code>href</code> attributes; Scala knows that we are assigning XML attributes to dynamic variables (i.e. this isn’t just blind templating; it’s XML-aware). Also note how the quoted string we pass to the function gets escaped inside the attribute value.</p>
<h4>Making it more dynamic</h4>
<p>Inside those curly braces, we can embed any Scala expression we want, so if we wanted to take a list and output it as a <code>ul</code>, this would work just fine:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/154851.js">
</script>
<p>Notice that inside our expression, we <code>map</code> our list of strings to a list of XML literals, themselves containing a dynamic expression.</p>
<p>Also note that we can put literal curly braces in by either doubling them outside of an attribute, or quoting them as an attribute’s value.</p>
<h2>My Thoughts on this Feature</h2>
<p>I think XML is one of the most abused and over-used pieces of software technology ever invented. So, on the one hand, any feature that makes using XML easier is immediately questionable. On the other hand, however, XML is a fact of life, and the way Scala supports XML literals is pretty nice, and very intuitive. I <strong>do</strong> find it curious why regular expression literals are not supported, as they are far more useful than XML.</p>
