<div class="entry-content"><p>
Finally pulled the trigger on <a href="http://www.cukes.info">Cucumber</a>, which allows one to write human-readable &#8220;features&#8221; that are essentially acceptance test cases.  You can then execute them by adding some glue code in a mish-mash of Ruby DSLs and verify functionality.
</p>
<p>
It took me quite a while to decide to get going on this because the examples and documentation that are available are extremely hypothetical and very hand-wavy.  A lot of the information glosses over the fact that you are <b>still writing code</b> and you still need to know <b>what the keywords are</b> and <b>what data you will be given</b>.   Arcane non-human-readable symbols are almost preferable when getting started, because you don&#8217;t get distracted by English.  This is why Applescript drives me insane.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, I found <a href="http://themomorohoax.com/2009/03/08/rails-machinist-tutorial-machinist-with-cucumber-in-10-minutes">this page</a>, which was pretty helpful.  It shows testing a rails app using, among other things, <a href="http://github.com/brynary/webrat/tree/master">webrat</a> (another tool severely lacking in documentation but that is, nonetheless, pretty awesome).
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m writing a basic wiki (for science) and so I thought a good feature would be &#8220;home page shows all pages in sorted order&#8221;, so I wrote it up:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>Feature: pages are sorted
 As anyone
 The pages should be listed on the home page in sorted order

 Scenario: Visit Homepage
   As anyone
   When I visit the homepage
   Then The list of pages should be sorted</code>
  </pre>
</div>

Now, the webrat/cucumber integration provided by rails means that the &#8220;plain English&#8221; has to actually conform to a subset of phrasing and terminology or you have to write the steps yourself (the features are everything under &#8220;Scenario&#8221;).  It&#8217;s not hard to do that, and it&#8217;s not hard to modify the default webrat steps, but it was a distraction intially.
</p>
<p>
Next up, you implement the steps and here is where the crazy intersection of Ruby DSLs really made things difficult.  The first two steps were pretty easy (&#8220;anyone&#8221; didn&#8217;t require any setup, and webrat successfully handled &#8220;When I visit the homepage&#8221;):
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>Then /The list of pages should be sorted/ do
  response.should # I have no clue wtf to do here
end</code>
  </pre>
</div>

A <tt>puts response.class</tt> and a puts <tt>response.methods</tt> gave me no useful information.  I eventually deduced that since Cucumber is a successor/add-on/something to RSpec, perhaps <tt>should</tt> comes from RSpec.  This takes a <tt>Matcher</tt> and webrat provides many.  Specifically, <tt>have_selector</tt> is available that allows selecting HTML elements based on the DOM.
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>Then /The list of pages should be sorted/ do
  response.should have_selector(&quot;ul.pages&quot;)
end</code>
  </pre>
</div>

<b>Success!</b> (sort of).  My feature executing is all green, meaning the home page contains &lt;ul class=&#8221;pages&#8221;&gt;.  <tt>have_selector</tt> also takes a block (totally undocumented as to what it is or does in the webrat documentation):
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>Then /The list of pages should be sorted/ do
  response.should have_selector(&quot;ul.pages&quot;) do |pages|
    # WTF is pages and what can I do with it?
  end
end</code>
  </pre>
</div>

A <tt>puts pages.class</tt> later and I realize this is a Nokogiri <tt>NodeSet</tt>.    Now, I&#8217;m in business, though it would&#8217;ve been nice to be told WTF some of this stuff was and what I can/should do with it.  At this point it was pretty trivial to select the page names from my HTML and check if they are sorted:
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>response.should have_selector('ul.pages') do |pages|
   page_names = []
   pages.should have_selector('li') do |li|
     li.should have_selector('.pagename') do |name|
       name.each do |one_name|
         page_names &amp;lt;&amp;gt; one_name.content
       end
     end
   end
   assert_equal page_names,page_names.sort
   true
 end</code>
  </pre>
</div>

(For some reason <tt>assert_equal</tt> doesn&#8217;t evaluate to true when it succeeds and the block evaluates to false and then Cucumber/RSpec/Webrat/Ruby Gods claim my page is missing the <tt>ul</tt> tag).  My initial implementation walked the DOM using Nokogiri&#8217;s  API directly, because I didn&#8217;t realize that <tt>should</tt> had been mixed in (on?) to the objects I was being given.  I&#8217;m still not sure if using that is the intention, but it seemed a bit cleaner to me.
</p>
<p>
So, this took me a couple of hours, mostly  because of a combination of dynamic typing and lack of documentation.  I&#8217;m all for dynamic typing, and I totally realize that these are free tools and all that.  I think if the Ruby community (and the dynamic typing community in general) wants to succeed and make a case that dynamic typing, DSLs, meta-programming and all this (admittedly awesome and powerful) stuff enhance productivity, there <b>has to be documentation</b> as to the types of user-facing objects. 
</p>
<p>
Now, given <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>&#8217;s general awesomeness, I&#8217;m totally willing to fork a repo, beef up the rdoc and request a pull, however I&#8217;m not even sure <b>whose</b> RDoc I could update to make this clear.  Just figuring out that the <tt>have_selector</tt> in <tt>response.should have_selector</tt> is part of webrat was nontrivial (I had to just guess that <tt>should</tt> was part of RSpec and that the <tt>Webrat::Matchers</tt> module was mixed in).  This is a problem and it&#8217;s not clear to me how to solve it.
</p>
<p>
That being said, I was then able to create three more features using this system in about 10 minutes, so overall, I&#8217;m really happy with how things are working.  Certainly if this were Java, I&#8217;d still be feeding XML to maven or futzing with missing semicolons.  So, it&#8217;s a net win for me.

  I'm a programmer, musician, and <a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">author</a>.  I speak frequently at national and regional conferences and spend my days currently as a lead engineer at <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a>. I've written applications in C, C++, Perl, Ruby, Scala, and many others, on large and small teams. As a developer, I believe in clean code, making it right, providing a great user experience and using the right tool for the job.  As a bass player, I believe in using a pick, locking it down, and ripping off Peter Hook.  As an author, I insist on the Oxford Comma, try to avoid semi-colons, and dislike title case.
