<div class="entry-content"><p>So, <a href="https://github.com/harthur/replace">someone shared some code</a> on Github and some classic <a href="http://harthur.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/771/">developer snark</a> rolled in.  And then
there were <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2013-01-23-node">some</a> <a href="http://programmingtour.blogspot.com/2013/01/im-sorry.html">apologies</a> about it.  I saw those snarky tweets when they came through, clicked to the Github
project, didn&#8217;t understand what the issue was, and went back to work.</p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;m all for bad projects and bad code being called out.  Our industry produces some shitty code, and a general lack of
craftsmanship can kill business, or even people.  So bad code needs to be pointed out.  The question is, is this bad code?  I
think we can all agree that if it <em>is</em> bad code, we should try to point it out in a more constructive way (and I know it&#8217;s easier
said than done), but let&#8217;s forget the tone and focus on the message.  Is <code>replace</code> a silly project, or implemented in a stupid
way?</p>

<p>No, it&#8217;s not.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I think we can evaluate a project based on three criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>should it exist at all?</li>
<li>does it use the right technology?</li>
<li>are the lines of code well written?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Should it exist at all?</h2>

<p><code>replace</code> is a command line app, which is something <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/dccar">near to my heart</a>.  Writing a command-line app to automate
something tedious is what good developers do (even if you can wrangle <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>mv</code> etc. to do it without scripting
it).  The use case of <code>replace</code> is one I&#8217;ve needed many times, and, when I did, I hacked together some pile of shit shell script
to do it one-off and then promptly deleted it because then no one would know my shame in having made such bad code.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;d say that it&#8217;s completely reasonable that this exists and wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if many people found it useful. I believe
this is why I initially didn&#8217;t understand the negative reaction.  I saw &#8220;some command line that makes search/replace across files
way easier than dealing with <code>sed</code> and friends&#8221; and figured that was useful and good.</p>

<h2>Does it use the right technology?</h2>

<p>This question is around identifying things like using Java to manage UNIX processes, or using Ruby for complex mathematical
processing - is this really the best use of the chosen technology.  In this case, the command line app is written in JavaScript and requires Node to be installed in order to execute.</p>

<p>In Avdi Grimm&#8217;s <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2013/01/24/im-sorry-too/">take on this</a> he writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>But I do share the opinion of a number of my colleagues that using a reactor-based framework in a language lacking native fibers, coroutines, continuations, or threads leads to messy code.</p></blockquote>

<p>I totally agree with Avdi on this, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s <em>that</em> relevant to the choice of technology here.  It turns out that if
you want to write a command-line app in JavaScript, Node is the best way to make that happen, as it gives you a nice &#8220;shebang&#8221;
style way of doing things, along with some I/O functions that don&#8217;t exist in regular JavaScript. The code for <code>replace</code> <em>does</em>
have async as an option, but it&#8217;s not like this thing pops up a web server and gets lost in callback hell.  And, even if it did,
I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s de-facto wrong to use Node for a command-line app, given that it&#8217;s written in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Which leads us to ask: &#8220;should command-line apps be written in JavaScript at all?&#8221;  Of course, it depends.  JavaScript isn&#8217;t the
<em>best</em> language to write CLI apps, but it&#8217;s not a bad choice.  It&#8217;s dynamically typed, has powerful code organization techniques, and supports collection, regex, &amp; object literals.  If you write a lot of JavaScript for your primary project, writing command-line tools in JavaScript makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>So, I think JavaScript is a fine choice of technology, and, because of this, Node is the most reasonable &#8220;JavaScript runtime&#8221; to
use.</p>

<h2>Is the code itself well written?</h2>

<p>For a command-line app, I would say it&#8217;s pretty good.  There&#8217;s a proper option parser in place, with useful and complete help
text, and all configureability is done via command-line options - as it should be.  The main thing this project is lacking is
automated tests, but it does include some sample files that can be used to exercise the app&#8217;s functionality via manual testing on
the command-line (that&#8217;s certainly better than <em>many</em> of the command-line scripts I&#8217;ve written over the years).</p>

<p>The main code itself, all contained in <code>replace.js</code>, is fairly straightforward.  The main routine is a bit complex, but it&#8217;s
not hard to follow and method extraction has clearly been used to keep the main routine readable.  I&#8217;m sure it could be done more
cleanly, but it&#8217;s pretty good as it is.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;d say this code is pretty well written.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Maybe you don&#8217;t like Node, or JavaScript, or command-line scripts that wrap or re-implement certain UNIX pipelines.  That&#8217;s fine,
and I won&#8217;t argue those points.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean that such things are inherently bad.  One of the hardest things to learn
as a developer is to stop making emotional arguments (or publicizing emotional responses) and start making <em>technical</em> arguments.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t claim to be great at this, but it&#8217;s something I spend time on trying to improve, even if it&#8217;s at the cost of learning
some new language or framework.  It&#8217;s an ongoing process, and this blog post is part of that process.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with some <em>actually</em> bad code from a bad project - one of mine: a Java project to parse a YAML-like format and
turn it into XML.  At the time, I&#8217;d never heard of YAML, and the entire thing uses regexes for parsing, along with a giant mess
of a &#8220;doit&#8221; method that&#8217;s screaming for a refactor.  Feast your eyes on <a href="https://github.com/davetron5000/fauxml/blob/master/src/java/com/naildrivin5/fauxml/Parser.java#L118">this</a>.  It should never have been made, nor
should it have been done in Java, and the code is quite a mess.</p>

  I'm a programmer, musician, and <a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">author</a>.  I speak frequently at national and regional conferences and spend my days currently as a lead engineer at <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a>. I've written applications in C, C++, Perl, Ruby, Scala, and many others, on large and small teams. As a developer, I believe in clean code, making it right, providing a great user experience and using the right tool for the job.  As a bass player, I believe in using a pick, locking it down, and ripping off Peter Hook.  As an author, I insist on the Oxford Comma, try to avoid semi-colons, and dislike title case.
