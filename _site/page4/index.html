<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/">Chromebook</a> yesterday and the keyboard, while sporting the same layout as most other computers, actually
is better designed for what the Chromebook does.</p>

<p>Namely, it has no function keys, instead using them for browser navigation, window management, and hardware controls.  Most amazingly, though, it has no
Caps Lock, instead making it a Search key, which makes sense.  It&#39;s a big key in a very prominent spot and Search is what Google wants you to do.</p>

          <div class="excerpt"><p>Jeff Atwood (AKA codinghorror), <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/08/the-code-keyboard.html">introduced a new computer keyboard</a>, produced by WASD, called <a href="http://codekeyboards.com/">the CODE keyboard</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I told him that the state of keyboards was unacceptable to me as a geek, and I proposed a partnership wherein I was willing to work with him to do whatever it takes to produce a truly great mechanical keyboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeff is heralding this as a &quot;truly great mechanical keyboard&quot;.  I was very eager to see what such a beast looked like.  Here it
is:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ModelM.jpg" alt="image"></p>

<p>Oh wait, sorry, that&#39;s the original 101-key version of the IBM PC Keyboard, introduced in 1985.  How&#39;d that get there?  It&#39;s been
almost thirty years, so the CODE keyboard must be awesome, right?</p>

<p>If you are building your first Rails app at your company, it doesn&#39;t matter.  They all work more or less the same, so just pick one and go.  Take a vote or declare by fiat, but get on with your life.  No project ever failed because they picked HAML over ERB.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you are building a new Rails application that runs in an existing technical infrastructure (which is far more likely), then these are the absolute wrong questions to be asking.  Use what your team already uses <em>unless there&#39;s a good technical reason not to</em>.  Why?</p>

<p>Because consistency is far more important than most other factors.</p>

            <p>My ex-colleague from LivingSocial, <a href="https://twitter.com/danmayer">Dan Mayer</a> posted a <a href="http://mayerdan.com/programming/2013/08/04/thoughts-on-continuous-deployment/">great read about continuous deployment</a>, and the tradeoffs when doing an automatic deploy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After considering some of the real world implications of automated continuous deployment, I didn’t feel it was right for our team on most of our projects at the moment. Both because we would need a bit of additional tooling around deployment and dashboards, and because our tests are far to slow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a good (and quick) read. Having worked on at least one of the apps that Dan&#39;s talking about, I would agree he&#39;s making the right call and that if your test suite is slow, automatic deployment can be a killer.  I also think there&#39;s a relationship between the size of the contributor group and the speed of the test suite - the more devs pushing stuff in, the faster it has to be.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">my book</a>, there&#39;s a chapter on bootstrapping new applications, and my recommendation is to set up automatic continuous deployment from the start.  I stand by that, because it basically turns the problem Dan identifies around: slow tests slow your deployment which should thus motivate keeping tests slow (and applications lean).  We&#39;ll see how it works out at <a href="http://stitchfixjobs.com/blog/2013/07/30/our-git-workflow/">Stitch Fix</a>.  We have one app with a somewhat slow test suite, and three with relatively fast ones.  Automatic deploys work really well so far.</p>

            <p>The Stitch Fix <a href="http://stitchfixjobs.com/blog">tech blog</a> is up, and I just posted <a href="http://stitchfixjobs.com/blog/2013/07/30/our-git-workflow/">how we use Git and Hubot</a> to automate deployment, without having a complex series of
branches and tags.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is fairly simple - new code goes on branches, master is always deployable (when clean), and <code>deploy/production</code> always contains whatever&#39;s on production. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">My book</a> talks about bootstrapping new applications, and my recommendation is to set up continuous deployment.  If you&#39;ve ever worked on a release
schedule, you&#39;ll know that continuous deployment is a pure joy.  It&#39;s also a boon to the users, who get the features and fixes as fast as possible.</p>

          <div class="excerpt"><p>Email is a fact of life.  It&#39;s the primary conduit through which all information in our work life flows.  Clients email us.
Users email us.  Project managers email us. Our issue management systems email us.  Heck, even our <em>apps</em> email us when things are going wrong.</p>

<p>Managing email can be tricky - if you spend too much time on it, you don&#39;t get any other work done, and if you don&#39;t spend enough
time on it, you appear flaky at best and incompetent at worst.  Over the past several years, I&#39;ve developed a system for managing
email as a developer that maximizes my responsiveness without creating an undue burden on my workload.  In short, I&#39;m a lot more
agile in how I deliver results by allowing emails to occasionally &quot;overrule&quot; my otherwise prioritized backlog.</p>

            <p>Last November, I did my own private <a href="http://pragprog.com/news/november-writing-month-pragmatic-guide-to-git-in-print">PragProWriMo</a>, writing every day that month to produce a non-fiction technology book:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>And that&#39;s IT! 671 words today for a total of 46,611 words. Now what?

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Between Dec 1, 2012 and today, I&#39;ve been editing it, and it&#39;s finally complete!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">The Senior Software Engineer</a> is a 200-page e-book on everything a developer needs to know to be a truly senior
engineer…except for how program.</p>

<p>The book&#39;s subtitle is &quot;A Guide for Making the Most of Your Career&quot; and that&#39;s exactly what it is.  I realized over the past few years
that the best and most successful developers I&#39;ve come across aren&#39;t just good at writing code.  They can communicate effectively
with others.  They can launch a greenfield project without incident.  They can write documentation.  They can lead others without
becoming managers who have to give up coding.</p>

<p>In short, these developers prioritize the delivery of results above all else.  They often (though not always) use software to
deliver those results.</p>

<p>This is the subject of the book.  It&#39;s designed to get you thinking about the big picture, of which computer programs are only a
small part.  It&#39;s a roadmap for advancing in your career without giving up writing code.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also prescriptive.  You&#39;ll learn how to give a code review as well as receive one.  You&#39;ll learn how to keep organized while
implementing complex features.  You&#39;ll learn how to create a convincing technical argument by understanding others&#39; priorities.
You&#39;ll learn how to interview potential team members, and then lead them to successful product delivery.  <a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">Check out the website</a>, where you&#39;ll find a full table of contents as well as some excerpts.</p>

<p>The lessons in this book have taken me a long time to learn, and I still struggle every day with many of them. My hope is
that if we all start thinking about this stuff earlier in our careers (at least as much as we think about the next great language or framework) we can do better work and make software better.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">It&#39;s available now for $25, in PDF, EPUB, MOBI, and Markdown</a>.  I hope you enjoy it.</p>
