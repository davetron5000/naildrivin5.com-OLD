          <div class="excerpt"><p>At <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a>, we outsource pretty much <em>all</em> of our hosting and technical needs to Heroku or their add-ons.  Given
where we are now as a company, it makes total sense: we don&#39;t need to hire an admin, we don&#39;t need to adminster actual boxes, and
we can easily add/remove/change our technical infrastructure.  If you are a small startup and you are messing with Linode slices,
   you are probably wasting time.</p>

<p>One thing Heroku doesn&#39;t provide out of the box is a login system for &quot;internal&quot; users.  The vast majority of the software at
Stitch Fix is targeted at Stitch Fix employees - to operate the warehouse, choose what goes into a fix, etc.  The natural way to
allow them to login is via Google Apps.  We can use everyone&#39;s existing username/password, and employees can be added during
onboarding and removed when they leave the company, all in one place.</p>

<p>Getting it to work with our Rails apps <em>seemed</em> easy enough with <a href="http://github.com/intridea/omniauth">OmniAuth</a>, but it turned out to be a lot trickier, resulting in
random failures with the oh-so-helpful error &quot;invalid_credentials&quot;.  Here&#39;s how to fix that, and why you can&#39;t just use the
out-of-box configurations recommend by OmniAuth.</p>

          <div class="excerpt"><p>From time to time, I see people in my twitter stream attempting to switch to Vim.  This is a
good thing.  The problem is that they appear to be viewing the switch as swapping out one
tool for another.  </p>

<p>This is not what switching to Vim means, nor is it a good reason to switch.</p>

<p>The reason to switch to Vim is to <em>work better</em>.  I realize &quot;better&quot; is subjective, but
whatever way <em>you</em> define it is what it means - code faster, edit text more easily, automate
your workflow, whatever.</p>

<p>As such, switching to Vim is to <em>throw out</em> your old editor (or plan to) and replace it with
a <em>different tool</em> that works differently and is, hopefully, better.  Stop asking for &quot;a
plugin that does XXX like Sublime Text does things&quot;.  If Sublime Text has a plugin for what
you want, you don&#39;t need Vim.  Vim might very well have a plugin that does whatever XXX is,
but it&#39;s more likely that you don&#39;t need a plugin, or that Vim provides a way to
accomplish your <em>real</em> goal much more efficiently.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how to make the move.</p>

up a browser, log in as the right person, navigate to just the right piece of data (which I
had to set up manually in the database), and click around to see if things are working.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I <em>do</em> do that, but only when the code is working according to my tests.  Or, when I have to write
JavaScript.  </p>

<p>At my <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/02/19/stitch-fix-slash.html">current job</a>, I&#39;m doing a lot more front-end than I had been, and so more
JavaScript.  The app I&#39;m working on is a Rails app, and so I looked into the current state of
the art with testing JavaScript.</p>

            <p>John Siracusa has, in his laser-focused, analytical style, perfectly captured something about technology that I always knew, but never <em>knew</em> I knew.   His latest post, <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/04/07/technological-conservatism">Technological Conservatism</a> is a must read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beneath what seems like a reasonable feature request lurks the heart of technological conservatism: <strong>what was and is always shall be.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(emphasis his).</p>

<p>I love everything about this, and it&#39;s a helluva lot better than [Steve Yegge&#39;s stinker][yegge].</p>

<p>Siracusa&#39;s article inspires me in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop holding &quot;what I know&quot; so dearly.  &quot;Lead or bleed&quot;, as <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">Chad Fowler says</a></li>
<li>Stop accepting unjustified idioms &amp; conventions as being &quot;more correct&quot;.  &quot;That&#39;s just the way it&#39;s done&quot; is often the best
explanation for doing things a particular way, but it&#39;s not actually a legitimate reason for anything.</li>

<p>RSS is a huge part of my online life - every time I fire up Reeder and see stories, I get very happy.  The way I use RSS (which I believe is the best way to use it) can&#39;t be replaced by anything else that I&#39;m aware of.</p>

how they solve &quot;The Rails Problem&quot; of complex Rails apps having obese models that stymie code re-use.  The naive approach is just <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/01/02/dci-vs-just-making-classes.html">to make classes</a>.</p>

<p>UserVoice&#39;s approach is different: they made a DSL for describing service calls.  The thing is, it&#39;s sort
of a type system - and a verbose one at that.</p>

My tenure at LivingSocial was short - it would&#39;ve certainly been longer had this opportunity not come along - but I learned a lot in the 14 months I worked there.</p>

<p>Sure, I learned stuff about Rails, Ruby, service-oriented architectures, asynchronous processing, and credit card payments.  But
that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about.  Those skills are great experience and will look just fine on my resume, but I learned two
things that made me a better developer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deliver results, not promises</li>
<li>Assume <em>everyone</em> knows what they&#39;re doing</li>

<p>Now, I&#39;m all for bad projects and bad code being called out.  Our industry produces some shitty code, and a general lack of

said than done), but let&#39;s forget the tone and focus on the message.  Is <code>replace</code> a silly project, or implemented in a stupid
